# SIMPLE REACTJS/WEBPACK4/TYPESCRIPT COMPONENT STARTER
I saw a lot of react application starters out on the internet, like create-react-app, but not a lot of basic out of the box simple component templates (or ones that were update to date with webpack 4, react 16,and typescript 3).

I'm just posting this here for now as a start - and might consider throwing this into a generator if it becomes popular.  I'll add testing tomorrow.

*Ignore the references to Julian for now, that's my son and this whole template started because I'm helping him make a video game.* :laughing:
